  - [ ] **Go to the "Security credentials" section.**
  - [ ] **Scroll down to the "Access keys" section.**

  - [ ] **Choose the purpose for the access key, such as CLI.**
  - [ ] **Acknowledge AWS's recommendations regarding alternative methods.**
  - [ ] **Check "I understand the above recommendation" to proceed.**
  - [ ] **Generate the access key and secret access key.**
  - [ ] **Save the access key and secret access key immediately as this is the only time they will be visible.**

  ### 3. Configure AWS CLI
  - [ ] **Open Command Prompt on Windows.**
  - [ ] **Run the command `aws configure`.**
  - [ ] **Enter the access key ID when prompted.**
  - [ ] **Enter the secret access key when prompted.**

  - [ ] **Confirm the output matches your IAM console, showing user details.**

  ### 5. Modify User Permissions
  - [ ] **Use your root account to remove the user (e.g., admin) from the "administration" group.**
  - [ ] **Verify the user now has no permissions.**

  ### 6. Test Permissions with CLI
  - [ ] **Run `aws iam list-users` in CLI.**
  - [ ] **Confirm that no response is returned due to lack of permissions.**

  ### 7. Re-add User to Administration Group
  - [ ] **Go back to "User groups."**
  - [ ] **Add the user (e.g., admin) back into the "admin" group to restore permissions.**
  - [ ] **Verify that the user permissions have been successfully restored.**

  <summary>Project 6 - Generate Credentials Report and Use IAM Last Accessed</summary>

  ###

  <a href="https://youtu.be/T0fCqBq8QOI" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6007b82-fcd1-49f0-ac0e-7a7c27af9025" width="720" height="400" /></a>

  ### 1. Generate a Credentials Report

    - MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) status.
    - Access keys status (created, rotated, last used).
    - Password rotation policy (if enabled).
  - [ ] Use the report to identify security concerns, such as:
    - Users who haven’t changed their passwords recently.
    - Accounts without MFA enabled.
    - Unused or outdated access keys.
  - [ ] Use the **Credentials Report** for periodic security audits.

  ### 3. Access IAM Last Accessed

  - [ ] Check the list of AWS services accessed by the user, including:
    - Services that were accessed and the last access date.
    - Services not accessed by the user.
  - [ ] Identify which permissions granted access to specific services (e.g., Amazon EC2 via AdministratorAccess policy).
  - [ ] Use the data from Access Advisor to determine if the user requires access to all granted services.
  - [ ] Consider removing unnecessary permissions for enhanced security.
  - [ ] Use **Access Advisor** to perform a granular review of user permissions and optimize access policies.
